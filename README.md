Instruction	Eval Criteria
"1. Create a ML model by selecting any 1 of the above mentioned usecase. 
Students can choose any algorithm and approach to build it. "	REST API for best_model_parameter[method to be used GET], prediction[ method to be used POST] and training[ method to be used POST]
2. Use hyper-parameter tuning techniuque to find the best model and log all experiment run using ML-Flow	Experiment artifact should be visible in the code github repository
3. Create a Docker container for the Backed API and push it to docker hub	A working Docker Image of your application showcasing both the ML-flow UI and the REST API
	
	
Guideline	
1. Students have to form a team of not more than 4 person. Single person team not recommended (have to take prior approval)	
2. Project team should use a single github repositroy for collaboaration	
"3. Each member should have a valid commit history of there contribution to the code repository. 
Any member who has no contribution will not be graded"	
4. Please do not copy code from ChatGPT	
5. AVOID pushing dataset to GitHub repo.
